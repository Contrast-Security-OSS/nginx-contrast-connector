# NGINX / Speedracer Connector #

This is a statically compiled module that allows NGINX to communicate with Speedracer using UNIX sockets and protobuf messages.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is a build environment heavily influenced by the tutorial code from Aaron Bedra
[here](https://github.com/abedra/nginx-auth-token-module) and the libmodsecurity connector from SpiderLabs
[here](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx).

This repository attempts to build all the compiled libraries necessary including:

* libmodsecurity (c++)
* OWASP libmodesecurty rule set (text)
* NGINX (c++)
* NGINX connector (c) 
* Speedracer (go)
